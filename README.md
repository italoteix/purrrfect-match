This project was created as a challenge for [GNAR](https://www.gnar.io/).
Itâ€™s a platform that helps people to find a cat for adoption, showing a list of cats and their info.

Regarding the layout, some dummy stuff was added just to make the project look more like a complete application, instead of just showing the required components.
If you just want to see how the application looks like, check the PAGES folder in this repo, or check the live demo here:

## Project Features

* Style library: Styled Components. Chosen because it's way better than CSS, as you have superpowers like css modularization, mixins and props.
* Framework: React.js. Chosen because it is a powerful framework that is built with a reactive way of thinking. It uses React Class Components and functional components, as a way to show capability to work with pre-hooks React components.

* Prettier and ESLint for a better standardized code.
* Chart.js to generate dynamic charts.
* Responsive application.
* Well moduled and componentially structured.
