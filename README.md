# Purrrfect Match

<p align="center"><img src="src/assets/images/logotype-blue.png" alt="logo"/></p>

This project was created as a challenge for [GNAR](https://www.gnar.io/).
Itâ€™s a platform that helps people to find a cat for adoption, showing a list of cats and their info.

Regarding the layout, some dummy stuff was added just to make the project look more like a complete application, instead of just showing the required components.
If you just want to see how the application looks like, check the PAGES folder in this repo, or check the live demo here: [Purrrfect Match](https://upbeat-thompson-aa5571.netlify.com/)

## Project Features

* Style library: [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/). Chosen because using CSS-in-JS gives you superpowers like modularization, theming, style scoping, mixins and props.
* Framework:  [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). Chosen because it is a powerful library that is built with a reactive way of thinking. This project uses React Class Components and functional components, as a way to show capability to work with pre-hooks React components.

* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for a better standardized code.
* [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to generate dynamic charts.
* Responsive application.
* Well moduled and componentially structured.
* Commits following a [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) structure for easier maintenance and automatic changelog/versioning.
